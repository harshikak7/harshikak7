Hi, I'm Harshika a UI/UX Designer. I enjoy working on design problems where things aren’t straightforward and users might already feel a little frustrated. 
I also enjoy working with code, which helps me design more realistically. When I’m not designing, you’ll usually find me reading, exploring ideas, or working on something creative just for fun.
